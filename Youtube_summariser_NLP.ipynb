        "Imagine getting a brief summary of a lengthy YouTube tutorial or video before watching itâ€”this would give you a quick understanding and save time. This project, a *YouTube Summarizer*, aims to do just that by summarizing the content (subtitles) of YouTube videos. Often, only 50-60% of a video's length contains the main content, so our summarizer will capture the key points to make the information concise and easy to understand.\n",

For our YouTube Summarizer, we use extractive summarization techniques, such as **BART** (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) and **TFIDF Vectorizer**(term frequency-inverse document frequency), to efficiently capture important details from the video content. This tool can be especially useful for summarizing lecture videos."
